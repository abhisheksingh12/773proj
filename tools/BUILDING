* Building megam

First of all, you need OCaml installed on the system.

To compile megam, open the Makefile, find -lstr, replace it with
-lcamlstr; find WITHCLIBS, make the include path your actual one (try
"find YourOcamlDirectory -name bigarray.h").

It's recommended you build with "make opt" to get an optimized
executable. After building, "mv megam.opt ../megam" and "make clean".

* Building crfsuite

Just run crfsuite.build.sh under `tools' directory.
